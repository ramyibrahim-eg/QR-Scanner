### Design Decisions

**Why Offline-First:**  
Network reliability varies globally. By building core functionality without network dependencies, the app provides consistent UX regardless of connectivity. Ads and optional features gracefully enhance the experience when online.

**Why Context API + Reducer:**  
Redux-like predictable state management without external dependencies. The `HistoryContext` provides atomic operations (ADD_SCAN, REMOVE_SCAN, CLEAR_HISTORY) with automatic persistence to AsyncStorage.

**Why Custom Hooks:**  
Encapsulates complex logic (permission checking, async state management) into reusable, testable units. Screens remain focused on UI rendering while hooks handle business logic.

**Why Centralized Design System:**  
Eliminates magic numbers and ensures visual consistency. All spacing values derive from an 8pt grid (`SPACING.sm = 8`, `SPACING.lg = 16`), typography follows semantic naming (`h1`, `body`, `caption`), and shadows use consistent elevation values.

### Scalability & Maintainability

- **Barrel Exports:** Enable clean imports (`import { Card, AnimatedButton } from '../components'`)
- **Single Responsibility:** Each module has one clear purpose
- **No Duplication:** Shared logic extracted to utils and hooks
- **Type Safety:** JSDoc type hints throughout for IDE autocomplete and error detection
- **Testing Ready:** Pure functions, dependency injection, mockable architecture

## UI/UX & Design System

### Design Philosophy

The app employs a premium, modern aesthetic with card-based layouts, smooth animations, and intuitive information hierarchy. Visual consistency is maintained through a centralized design system defined in `src/config/theme.js`.

### Design System Tokens

**Spacing (8pt Grid):**

- `xs: 4px` - Minimal spacing between related elements
- `sm: 8px` - Default component internal padding
- `md: 12px` - Standard vertical rhythm
- `lg: 16px` - Primary card padding
- `xl: 24px` - Section spacing
- `xxl: 32px` - Screen-level margins

**Typography:**

- `h1: 32px/bold` - Screen titles
- `h2: 24px/bold` - Section headers
- `h3: 20px/semibold` - Card titles
- `body: 16px/regular` - Primary content
- `bodySmall: 14px/regular` - Secondary text
- `caption: 12px/regular` - Timestamps, metadata

**Shadows (Elevation):**

- `sm: elevation 2` - Subtle depth for inputs
- `md: elevation 4` - Standard button elevation
- `lg: elevation 8` - Card and modal elevation

**Border Radius:**

- `sm: 8px` - Buttons, small containers
- `md: 12px` - Standard cards
- `lg: 16px` - Large cards
- `xl: 20px` - Premium containers
- `full: 999px` - Fully rounded (pills, avatars)

### Animation & Interaction Principles

- **Spring Physics:** Button presses use natural spring animations (scale to 0.95x with bounce)
- **Meaningful Transitions:**
  - Splash → Fade (smooth entrance)
  - Scanner → Fade (focus on camera)
  - Result → Slide from bottom (emergent content)
  - Navigation → Slide from right (hierarchy)
- **Touch Feedback:** All interactive elements provide immediate visual response
- **Performance Target:** 60fps for all animations using React Native's Animated API

### Accessibility & Touch Ergonomics

- **Minimum Touch Targets:** 44×44pt (iOS HIG) / 48×48dp (Material Design)
- **Color Contrast:** Aims for WCAG AA text contrast ratios
- **Clear Labels:** Descriptive button text, no ambiguous icons
- **Large Tap Areas:** Buttons sized for thumb-friendly interaction
- **Status Indicators:** Loading states, error messages, success confirmations

## Performance & Reliability

### Offline-First Behavior

**Core Functionality (Always Available):**

- Camera scanning with real-time detection
- Gallery image import and QR extraction
- Complete scan history viewing and management
- Language switching with persistent preferences
- Copy to clipboard and native share functionality

**Optional Features (Online Only):**

- Banner advertising with intelligent connection detection
- URL opening (requires network for web content)

**Connection Management:**

- 3-second timeout on network checks (prevents app freezing)
- Graceful fallback when offline (ads hidden, non-blocking)
- Ads render only when connected (non-blocking)

### Optimized Camera Usage

- **Hardware Acceleration:** Uses Vision Camera's native modules for frame processing
- **Frame Limiting:** Processes frames at optimal intervals (not every frame)
- **Debouncing:** 500ms delay prevents duplicate scans from single QR code
- **Resource Cleanup:** Camera released when screen unmounts or app backgrounds

### State Management & Rendering Efficiency

- **useCallback Memoization:** Event handlers memoized to prevent unnecessary child re-renders
- **Lazy Initialization:** History context loads from storage once on mount
- **Atomic Updates:** State changes batched for efficient reconciliation
- **FlatList Virtualization:** Large history lists render only visible items

### Safe Resource Management

- **Memory Leak Prevention:** All `useEffect` hooks include proper cleanup functions
- **Async Cancellation:** Promises checked before state updates (component may have unmounted)
- **Subscription Cleanup:** Network listeners, camera subscriptions properly disposed
- **Error Boundaries:** Try-catch blocks around all async operations with user-friendly error messages

## Internationalization

### Supported Languages (20)

English (`en`), Arabic (`ar`), French (`fr`), Spanish (`es`), German (`de`), Chinese Simplified (`zh`), Hindi (`hi`), Portuguese (`pt`), Russian (`ru`), Japanese (`ja`), Italian (`it`), Korean (`ko`), Turkish (`tr`), Dutch (`nl`), Swedish (`sv`), Polish (`pl`), Indonesian (`id`), Thai (`th`), Persian (`fa`), Urdu (`ur`)

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

Automatic layout mirroring for **Arabic**, **Persian**, and **Urdu** with native text direction handling.

### Translation Workflow

All UI strings are extracted to JSON files in `src/i18n/locales/`. The app uses i18next with react-i18next bindings for declarative translations.

**Key Structure Example:**

```json
{
  "home": {
    "title": "QR Scanner",
    "scanButton": "Scan QR Code",
    "historyButton": "View History"
  }
}
```

**Usage in Components:**

```javascript
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
const { t } = useTranslation();
<Text>{t('home.title')}</Text>;
```

### Translation Validation

A validation tool ensures consistency across all 20 locale files:

**Check Mode (CI/CD):**

```bash
node src/i18n/validateTranslations.js --mode=check
```

**Fix Mode (Development):**

```bash
node src/i18n/validateTranslations.js --mode=fix
```

The validator detects missing keys, structural mismatches, and optionally flags untranslated English strings.

## Advertising (Android)

### Overview

Advertising is implemented on Android as an optional bottom banner. It is integrated through a native view bridge and exposed to React Native as a simple component.

The app is designed so that ads never block core functionality and do not appear while offline.

### Connection-Aware Display Logic

```javascript
// Pseudocode: render ads only when online
if (isConnected) {
  renderBannerAd();
}
```

**Behavior:**

- App launches → Check connection (max 3s)
- If offline → Hide banner immediately (no freeze, no error)
- If online → Display banner
- Connection changes → Auto-adjust banner visibility

### UX rules

- Banner positioned at screen bottom (natural eye flow)
- Never blocks primary content or navigation
- Graceful absence when offline (no error states)
- Avoids disruptive refresh/remount behavior

Note: Provider identifiers/keys are intentionally not documented in this public README.
